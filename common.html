			<h2>
			Microsoft Windows
			</h2>
			<p style="font-size:20px">Microsoft Windows has existed in one form or another since 1985,
			 and it remains the most popular operating system for home and office computers. Its latest versions, 
			including Windows 10, are also used on some tablets, and the OS is used on some web and number-crunching
			 server computers as well. Computers from a wide variety of manufacturers can use Windows.
			Initial versions of Windows worked with an earlier Microsoft operating system 
			called MS-DOS, providing a modern graphical interface on top of DOS's traditional 
			text-based commands. Signature features of Microsoft Windows's user interface include 
			windows themselves â€“ rectangle-shaped, on-panel screens that represent individual applications.
			 The Windows Start menu has helped generations of users find programs and files on their devices.
			Efforts to use versions of the Windows OS for smartphones have been less successful.

			<h2>
			Apple iOS	
			</h2>
			<p style="font-size:20px">Apple's iOS is one of the most popular smartphone operating systems,
			second only to Android. It runs on Apple hardware, including iPhones, iPad tablets and iPod Touch media players.

			Signature features of iOS include the App Store where users buy apps 
			and download free software, an emphasis on security including strong encryption 
			to limit what unauthorized users can extract from the phone, and a simple, streamlined 
			interface with minimal hardware buttons
			</P>
			<h2>
			Google's Android OS
			</h2>
			<p style="font-size:20px">Android is the most popular operating system in the world judging by 
			the number of devices installed. Largely developed by Google, it's chiefly used on smartphones and tablets.
			 Unlike iOS, it can be used on devices made by a variety of different manufacturers, and those makers can 
			tweak parts of its interface to suit their own needs.

			Users can download custom versions of the operating system because large portions of it are open source,
			 meaning anyone can legally modify it and publish their own. However, most people prefer to stick with 
			the version that comes on their devices.

			Android, like iOS, comes with an application and media store called the Play Store built by Google.
			 Some phone manufacturers and other organizations also offer their own stores to install software and media.
			</p>
			<h2>
			Apple macOS
			</h2>
			<p style="font-size:20px">Apple's macOS, successor to the popular OS X operating system, runs on Apple
			 laptops and desktops. Based in part on the historic family of Unix operating systems dating back to research in the 
			1960s at AT&T's Bell Labs, macOS shares some features with other Unix-related operating systems including Linux.
			 While the graphical interfaces are different, many of the underlying programming interfaces and command line features are the same.

			Signature elements of macOS include the dock used to find programs and frequently used files, unique keyboard
			 keys including the Command key, and the stoplight-colored buttons used to resize open program windows. MacOS 
			is known for its user-friendly features, which include Siri, a natural-voice personal assistant, and FaceTime,
			 Apple's video-calling application.
			<h2>
			Linux Operating System
			</h2>
			<p style="font-size:20px"> like many other operating systems, development on Linux isn't led by any one company. 
			The operating system was created by Finnish programmer Linus Torvalds in 1991. Nowadays, programmers from all over the world
			 collaborate on its open source code and submit tweaks to the central kernel
			 software and other programs.

			A wide assortment of commercial and open source software is available for Linux, 
			and various Linux distributions provide custom user interfaces and tools for 
			installing software onto machines running the operating system. A favorite of many programmers,
			 Linux is widely used on corporate and scientific servers, including cloud computing environments. 
			Linux can be run on a wide variety of hardware and is available free of charge over the internet
